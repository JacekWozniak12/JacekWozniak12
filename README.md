I'm interested in writing game mechanics both in theory as in practice. I'm looking for work.

I had to create some minigames using TypeScript language. I had created Tic-Tac-Toe game and simple canvas driven game, where you have to subdue other figures with your player, but you can only subdue figures with your color and die from contacting with figure with another color. 

##### [Audio in 3D world](https://github.com/JacekWozniak12/PPzD-3D)
